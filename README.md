# Landmark-Detection-Tracking

Simulataneous Localization & Mapping(SLAM) is an active area of research in the field of autonomous systems & robotics. In this project, a map of an environment is created from sensor and motion data gathered by a robot over time and SLAM was implemented for a 2D world. This is my solution to Udacity's Landmark Detection & Tracking Project which is a requirement to complete the Computer Vision Nano degree.
